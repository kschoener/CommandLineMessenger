# CommandLineMessenger

Currently I'm splitting my focus between developing the command line messenger interface and the webscraping of DiscordApp.com
I wish to provide a simple and smooth user experience when messaging via the command line.
After this is completed, I want to not only be able to see messages but send them and load new messages.
