# CommandLineMessenger

I've run into issues attempting to login to Discordapp via requests. While I'm digging into that problem I will be focusing on the command line interface
I'll add in colors so that the user can choose a color scheme that suits them.

My goal is to provide a simple and smooth user experience when messaging via the command line. And giving hackers their dream messaging service

The idea behind scraping data from Discordapp is to provide a very in depth example on the capabilities of the messaging interface, so hopefully in the future developers will implement my messaging interface with their own chat services or their own hacks on bigger chat services like Slack or Facebook Messenger
